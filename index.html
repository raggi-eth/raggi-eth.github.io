                <h1>decent is a platform where creators can share their work and build sustainable careers without
                    fear of being demonetized.</h1>
                <P>The creative industry is a vital part of our culture and economy, but it has long been plagued by
                    centralized entities that exert significant control over content and how it is monetized. This has
                    led to numerous instances of creators being demonetized or censored for arbitrary reasons, leaving
                    them without a reliable income stream or a way to showcase their work.
                </P>
                <p>Sign up for early access and be the first to try it out!</p>

                <h1>Liberation</h1>
                <p>decent aims to provide a solution to these issues by giving creators a way to connect with their

                    <li>Monetizing content: If you're a creator looking to monetize your content, you can use our

                        could be a great way to generate income and sustain your creative pursuits.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, our platform is a powerful tool that allows creators to connect with their supporters, fund
                    their projects, and monetize their content in a variety of ways.</p>

                <h1>Creators</h1>
                <p>our platform is a great way for creators to connect with their audience and monetize their work in a
                    fair and transparent way. By using blockchain technology, we've created a decentralized platform
                    that gives creators complete control over their content and how it's shared with their audience.</p>

                <h1>Patrons</h1>
                <p>our platform is also perfect for patrons who want to support their favorite creators and help them
                    build sustainable careers. Again, thanks to blockchain technology, we've created a decentralized
                    platform that gives patrons complete control over how they support their favorite creators.</p>

                <h1>Collectors</h1>
                <p>Our platform is a great opportunity for collectors who want to invest in and own the content of their
                    favorite creators, while also helping them build sustainable careers. Thanks to blockchain
                    technology, we've created a decentralized platform that gives collectors complete control over how
                    they support and invest in their favorite creators. In the near future, collectors may even have the
                    opportunity to join the monetization chain and participate in the community economy of our platform.
                    So not only do collectors get to own and support the content they love, they may also have the
                    chance to financially benefit from their investments. It's a win-win situation!</p>

                <h1>How it works</h1>
                <p>Our platform is built on the Polygon blockchain, which means that it is completely decentralized and
                    transparent. This means that creators have complete control over their content and how it is shared
                    with their audience. It also means that patrons have complete control over how they support their
                    favorite creators.
                    <br><br>
                    Creators can use our platform to crowdfund their creative projects and deliver the finished product
                    to their supporters. It can also be used like a Patreon site, where creators can give their fans
                    early or
                    exclusive access to their content. Or, if you're a creator looking to monetize your content, you can
                    sell access to your premium content to your most dedicated fans and followers.
                    <br><br>
                    One key feature of our platform is that it is powered by a single minting contract. This means that
                    all of the creative projects and exclusive unlockable content on the platform are secured and
                    delivered through this contract. This ensures that the distribution and access to content is fair
                    and transparent for both creators and patrons.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, the platform uses the darkblock protocol to secure and deliver all of the exclusive
                    content. This ensures that the content remains accessible only to those who have paid for access,
                    while also allowing for easy delivery and management of the content. Overall, the combination of the
                    single minting contract and the darkblock protocol helps to create a seamless and secure experience
                    for both creators and patrons on the platform.

                <h1>"Technical" Overview</h1>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the core of our platform is a shared ERC1155 minting
                        contract. This
                        contract is used to create multiple types of tokens within a single contract, which means we can
                        make all sorts
                        of NFTs for different parts of the platform. Plus, the ERC1155 standard also lets us transfer a
                        bunch of
                        multiple tokens in just one transaction. That&#39;s way more efficient than other NFT
                        standards!</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We also have an API that manages everything
                        related to
                        minting from the contract, including all the metadata for each token id. The base_uri of the
                        minting
                        contract points to a route in the API, which fetches the right metadata for each id based on the
                        contract
                        address, token id, and flags.</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now for the really cool part: our exclusive platform content. We use the
                        Darkblock
                        protocol to add unlockable content to NFTs. This protocol encrypts the content and links it to a
                        specific
                        NFT or multiple NFTs, so only NFT holders can access the content. Neat, right?</span></p>
                        <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have four types of NFTs on the platform:</span></p>

                            you&#39;re
                            following them on the platform. Profile NFTs make it easy to find and follow other users,
                            and they also
                            help verify users&#39; identities. The unlimited supply of these NFTs means anyone can

                            supply of
                            post NFTs lets users engage with and show support for the content on the platform. Plus, the

                            creator&#39;s settings when they set up the token metadata. Minting a content container NFT
                            gives you
                            permanent access to the exclusive content and the ability to deploy access NFTs for that
                            content. This
                            lets creators involve their communities in the distribution of their content and lets other
                            users become
                            curators on the platform.</span></li>

                    <li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Access NFT: this represents mutable access to a
                            creator&#39;s
                            exclusive content. Access can be granted on a per-view basis or for a set period of time,
                            depending on
                            the creator&#39;s preferences. Minting an access NFT lets you view the exclusive content for
                            the
                            agreed-upon time. The proceeds from the sale of access NFTs are shared between the
                            collector, creator,
                            and the platform, providing a way for creators to monetize their content and for users to
