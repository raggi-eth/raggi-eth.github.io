                <h1>decent is a platform where creators can share their work and build sustainable careers without
                    fear of being demonetized.</h1>
                <P>The creative industry is a vital part of our culture and economy, but it has long been plagued by
                    centralized entities that exert significant control over content and how it is monetized. This has
                    led to numerous instances of creators being demonetized or censored for arbitrary reasons, leaving
                    them without a reliable income stream or a way to showcase their work.
                </P>
                <p>decent aims to provide a solution to these issues by giving creators a way to connect with their
                    audience and monetize their work in a fair and transparent manner. By using blockchain technology,
                    we are able to create a decentralized platform that gives creators complete control over their
                    content and how it is shared with their audience.
                </p>

                <p>We believe that our platform has the potential to revolutionize the creative industry, giving
                    creators the freedom and autonomy they need to succeed in today's digital landscape. Whether you are
                    a seasoned creator or just starting out, our platform is here to help you connect with your audience
                    and build a sustainable career as a creative.

                <h1>Creators</h1>
                <p>our platform is a great way for creators to connect with their audience and monetize their work in a
                    fair and transparent way. By using blockchain technology, we've created a decentralized platform
                    that gives creators complete control over their content and how it's shared with their audience.</p>

                <h1>Patrons</h1>
                <p>our platform is also perfect for patrons who want to support their favorite creators and help them
                    build sustainable careers. Again, thanks to blockchain technology, we've created a decentralized
                    platform that gives patrons complete control over how they support their favorite creators.</p>

                <h1>Collectors</h1>
                <p>Our platform is a great opportunity for collectors who want to invest in and own the content of their
                    favorite creators, while also helping them build sustainable careers. Thanks to blockchain
                    technology, we've created a decentralized platform that gives collectors complete control over how
                    they support and invest in their favorite creators. In the near future, collectors may even have the
                    opportunity to join the monetization chain and participate in the community economy of our platform.
                    So not only do collectors get to own and support the content they love, they may also have the
                    chance to financially benefit from their investments. It's a win-win situation!</p>
                <h1>Owerall</h1>
                <p>our platform is a great place for creators, patrons, and collectors to connect, support each other,
                    and build sustainable careers. Whether you're a creator looking to share your work, a patron wanting
                    to support your favorite creators, or a collector looking for investment opportunities, we've got
                    you covered!</p>

                <h1>How it works</h1>
                <p>Our platform is built on the Polygon blockchain, which means that it is completely decentralized and
                    transparent. This means that creators have complete control over their content and how it is shared
                    with their audience. It also means that patrons have complete control over how they support their
                    favorite creators.
                    <br><br>
                    Creators can use our platform to crowdfund their creative projects and deliver the finished product
                    to
                    their supporters. It's also like a Patreon site, where creators can give their fans early or
                    exclusive access to their content. Or, if you're a creator looking to monetize your content, you can

                    <br><br>
                    One key feature of our platform is that it is powered by a single minting contract. This means that
                    all of the creative projects and exclusive unlockable content on the platform are secured and
                    delivered through this contract. This ensures that the distribution and access to content is fair
                    and transparent for both creators and patrons.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition, the platform uses the darkblock protocol to secure and deliver all of the exclusive
                    content. This ensures that the content remains accessible only to those who have paid for access,
                    while also allowing for easy delivery and management of the content. Overall, the combination of the
                    single minting contract and the darkblock protocol helps to create a seamless and secure experience
                    for both creators and patrons on the platform.

                <h1>"Technical" Overview</h1>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">At the core of our platform is a super cool shared ERC1155 minting
                        contract. This
                        contract lets us create multiple types of tokens within a single contract, which means we can
                        make all sorts
                        of NFTs for different parts of the platform. Plus, the ERC1155 standard also lets us transfer a
                        bunch of
                        different token types in just one transaction. That&#39;s way more efficient than other NFT
                        standards!</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">But wait, there&#39;s more! We also have an API that manages everything
                        related to
                        minting from the contract, including all the metadata for each token id. The base_uri of the
                        minting
                        contract points to a route in the API, which fetches the right metadata for each id based on the
                        contract
                        address, token id, and flags.</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">Now for the really cool part: our exclusive platform content. We use the
                        Darkblock
                        protocol to add unlockable content to NFTs. This protocol encrypts the content and links it to a
                        specific
                        NFT or multiple NFTs, so only NFT holders can access the content. Neat, right?</span></p>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">We have four types of NFTs on the platform:</span></p>
                <ul class="c6 lst-kix_vv48619i3lbe-0 start">
                    <li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Profile NFT: this represents a user&#39;s profile on
                            the
                            platform. Any user can mint one for free, and minting someone else&#39;s profile means
                            you&#39;re
                            following them on the platform. Profile NFTs make it easy to find and follow other users,
                            and they also
                            help verify users&#39; identities. The unlimited supply of these NFTs means anyone can
                            follow as many
                            users as they want, making it easy to build a community on the platform.</span></li>
                    <li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Post NFT: this represents a post to the communal
                            feed. Like the
                            profile NFT, these are free to mint and minting a post NFT means you like it. The unlimited
                            supply of
                            post NFTs lets users engage with and show support for the content on the platform. Plus, the
                            ability to
                            switch between chronological, followed users, or most liked posts feeds lets users customize
                            their
                            experience on the platform.</span></li>
                    <li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Content Container NFT: this is where creators store
                            their
                            exclusive content. The supply of these NFTs can be either unlimited or limited, depending on
                            the
                            creator&#39;s settings when they set up the token metadata. Minting a content container NFT
                            gives you
                            permanent access to the exclusive content and the ability to deploy access NFTs for that
                            content. This
                            lets creators involve their communities in the distribution of their content and lets other
                            users become
                            curators on the platform.</span></li>
                    <li class="c3 c4 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0">Access NFT: this represents mutable access to a
                            creator&#39;s
                            exclusive content. Access can be granted on a per-view basis or for a set period of time,
                            depending on
                            the creator&#39;s preferences. Minting an access NFT lets you view the exclusive content for
                            the
                            agreed-upon time. The proceeds from the sale of access NFTs are shared between the
                            collector, creator,
                            and the platform, providing a way for creators to monetize their content and for users to
                            support their
                            favorite creators.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="c3"><span class="c0">In summary, NFTs on our platform offer a unique and interactive
                        experience for both
                        creators and users. Creators can involve their communities in the distribution and promotion of
                        their
                        content, and users can show support for their favorite creators and curate their own feeds based
                        on their
                        interests. Cool, huh?</span></p>
